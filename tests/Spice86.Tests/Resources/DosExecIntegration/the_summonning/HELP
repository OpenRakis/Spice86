To run type SUMMON

Supports VGA 256 color ONLY. It will play music on the SoundBlaster or Adlib, 
Roland MT-32/LAPC-1, Tandy 3-voice, and IBM speaker. Sound effects play on
the Soundblaster, Adlib, and Adlib compatibles.

Run SETUP to select a sound device, to select an input device, and to 
modify expanded memory usage.

Press F9 to toggle sound on/off in the game.
Press ALT-Q to quit the game.

Save files in The Summoning start off fairly small, but increase in size as
you progress through the game. As you reach the end of the game they will be
up to 800K in size! If you like to save alot, be aware that you will need
alot of space on your hard drive to do so!

For proper map printing, your printer MUST be set up to print out using
the full IBM character set. Otherwise you will not get lines for walls.
If you are using a laser printer, this may require you to change the current 
display font; Refer to your printer documentation for instructions on how 
to do this. Also, if you are printing out conversations on a laser printer, 
you might have to press the Form Feed button to see the end of your 
conversation, as it might not have filled up a full page in the laser 
printer's memory.

***** Quick information on character attributes *****

For all attributes, a value of 10 is average. In general, values lower than
10 will be detrimental, and values larger than 10 will be helpful.

STRENGTH:  Strength affects the amount of weight you may carry, and it
           increases the amount of damage you do with melee weapons.

AGILITY:   Agility directly affects the speed of your character. An agility 
           of 15 or greater will grant speed bonuses. Your agility will also 
           affect your ability to hit opponents during combat.

ENDURANCE: Endurance will reduce through tiring activities, such as
           long combats, playing encumbered, or by pushing heavy objects
           long distances. Reduced endurance will slow you down.

ACCURACY:  Accuracy affects your ability to hit with any weapon, but it is 
           more critical when you are using projectile weapons. 

TALENT:    Talent directly affects the number of spells you may memorize.

POWER:     Power directly affects the results of most spells. The higher 
           your power, the greater the result. For example, power affects 
           the damage of some spells, and the durations of others.
