/// <summary>
/// Handles coherency between the memory and the graph of instructions executed by the CPU.
/// Next node to execute is normally the next node from the graph but several checks are done to make sure it is really it:
///  - The node is not null (otherwise it is taken from memory)
///  - If the node is an assembly node, it is the same as what is currently in memory, otherwise it means self modifying code is being detected
///  - If self modifying code is being detected, Discriminator node is being injected instead.
/// Once the node to execute is determined, it is linked to the previously executed node in the execution context if possible.
